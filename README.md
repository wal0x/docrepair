This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 6.1.5.

## Requirements

Before even thinking about this project, you need to have node.js and npm installed. 

## Start Developement Environment

Run `npm install -g @angular/cli` to install Angular-cli.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).

## Testing prod on computer (This is what Alex do)

Run `npm install -g lite-server` to install a server on your machine.
Then navigate in your console inside the folder `dist`, and run `lite-server`. This will create a webserver and open your browser, and serve the generated `index.html`.
